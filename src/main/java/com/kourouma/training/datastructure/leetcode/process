Process for problem solving I use in leetcode:

    1. Read the problem twice to understand it - ( ask clarifying questions)

    2. Try to think basically of different way to solve the problem

    3. Think end-to-end (e2e) of the best solutions bases on  complexity

    4. Write the algorithm from patterns in drawing

    5. Code it out

    6. Try and improve it once you think you're finished

    7. Go through other solutions (even if you answered correctly)
